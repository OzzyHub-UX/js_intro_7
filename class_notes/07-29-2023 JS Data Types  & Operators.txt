RECAP:
Output statement: console.log()

let age = 45;

console.log("Age is " + age); // "Age is 45"

Concatination => putting together stings or strings with variables 
+ is used for Concatination and addition (Math Operator)

number + number   -> Math - addition
string + string   -> Concatination
number + string   -> Concatination
string + string   -> Concatination


VARIABLES
var: was used before ES6 (2015)
const: immutable - cannot be changed - final 
let: mutable - can be changed - not final


IT: Information Technology
information: Data

DATA TYPES:
string: email, name, lname, address, ssn...
    we store strings in double quotes, single quotes

numbers: age, prices, quantity...
    whole numbers: 10, 5
    floating numbers: 10.5, 1.235

boolean: true or false

Reference types: complex advanced data 



The difference between =, ==, ===
= assignment operator 
== comparison 
=== strict comparison


undefined vs null
undefined: it is a variable declared but not assigned with any value
let age;

null: it is variable assigned with null (explicitly). It states you have no information about the value.
let age = null; 



JS Operators
= assignment operator

Arithmetic Operators
+ sum or addition
* multiplication-product 
- subtraction
/ divison
% modulus / remainder 
** exponentiation 
++ increment
-- decrement

Comparison Operators
== equals
=== strict
!= Not equals 
!== strict not equals 
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equals
<= less than or equals

Logical Operators
&& and 
|| or
! not


15 % 4 = 3
27 % 8 = 3
21 % 21 = 0
75 % 25 = 0
3 % 5 = 3


1. if the number on the left is less than the number on the right   => the result is the left number itself
2. if the left number is greater than the right number              => you find the remainder
3. if the left number is divisible by the right number              => the result is ZERO


PRIORITY
1. parantheses
2. exponentiation
3. multiplication, division
4. addition, subtraction
