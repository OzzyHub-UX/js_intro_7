NaN = Not a number 


When to create a variable to store data?
-When you will use it more than one time!!!


Assignment Operator - Shorthand
=  assignment operator 
+= 
-=
*=
**=
/=
%=


let number = 10;

// number = number * 5
number *= 5;

console.log(number); // 50

number *= 5;

EXPONENTIATION
5 ** 2  => 5 * 5 = 25
5 ** 3  => 5 * 5 * 5 = 125


INCREMENT & DECREMENT OPERATORS 
-These are used to increase or decrease a variable value by 1

post-increment vs pre-increment 
post-decrement vs pre-decrement 


variable++; // variable value does not change in this line but it will be increased by1 next time
variable--; // variable value does not change in this line but it will be decreased by1 next time
++variable; // variable value increased by 1 and it is new value to be used after that
--variable; // variable value decreased by 1 and it is new value to be used after that



COMPARISON OPERATORS 
==    compare ONLY values and return true if they are equal
===   compare both values and data types and return true if both values and data types are equal 

"3" == 3    -> true
"2" === 2   -> false 
"3" === "3" -> true


3 + "5" -> 35

true  -> 1
false -> 0
null  -> 0
""    -> 0
