Write a function named repeatingX() which takes a string argument and returns true if the 
letter x is followed by another x. Otherwise, return false.
NOTE: This method should be case-insensitive.

// Task02

/*
Write a function named isPerfectSquare() which takes a number as an argument and checks 
if it is a perfect square. It returns true if the number is a perfect square and false otherwise.
NOTE: A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the 
product of an integer by itself or as the second exponent of an integer. 
For example, 25 is a perfect square because it is the product of integer 5 
by itself, 5 Ã— 5 = 25. However, 21 is not a perfect square number because it 
cannot be expressed as the product of two same integers.
